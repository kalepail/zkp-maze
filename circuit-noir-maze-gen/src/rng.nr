// Pedersen Hash-Based PRNG for ZK Circuits
// Optimized for minimal gate count in zero-knowledge proofs
//
// PRNG CHOICE RATIONALE:
//
// - Park-Miller LCG: Expensive modulo operations (5,000-10,000 gates each)
// - Xoshiro128PlusPlus: Bitwise operations expensive in ZK (2-3x worse than Pedersen)
// - Pedersen Hash (chosen): ZK-friendly with low gate count (~500-1,000 gates per hash)
//
// This implementation uses Pedersen hash, which is designed for elliptic curve
// operations and translates efficiently to arithmetic circuits. Bitwise PRNGs
// like Xoshiro require decomposing each rotation/XOR into many constraints,
// making them impractical for zero-knowledge proofs.
//

// - Noir std library: std::hash::pedersen_hash
// - ZK PRNG research: Pedersen ~1K gates vs Xoshiro ~3K+ gates per iteration
