- [x] write a version of the noir circuit in traditional Circom to see how it compares
    - In my tests Circom actually straight up couldn't do what Noir is doing. Something about R1CS being bad at handling arrays and loops
- [ ] write a version of this with risc0 to see how it compares (I think we should be able to get generic maze proving)
- [x] do witness gen and proof verification locally (right now all three (witness, prover and verification) all happen remotely when remote is selected)
